            <h1>Oral Health and Nutrition: What You Should Know</h1>
            <p>Oral health and nutrition are closely linked, and what you eat plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy smile. Proper nutrition is essential not only for your overall health but also for the health of your teeth and gums. Consuming the right foods can help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other dental problems, while poor dietary choices can lead to oral health issues.</p>
    
            <h2>The Role of Nutrition in Oral Health</h2>
            <p>Your diet directly impacts the health of your teeth and gums. A balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients supports strong teeth and gums, while sugary and acidic foods can cause decay and irritation. Certain nutrients are particularly beneficial for maintaining oral health.</p>
    
            <h2>Key Nutrients for Healthy Teeth</h2>
            <p><strong>Calcium</strong> is one of the most important minerals for healthy teeth and bones. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are rich in calcium, which helps strengthen tooth enamel and supports bone density. Non-dairy sources such as leafy greens, almonds, and fortified plant-based milks also provide calcium.</p>
            <p><strong>Vitamin D</strong> is crucial for the absorption of calcium and the overall health of your teeth and gums. Vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight, fortified foods, and fatty fish like salmon.</p>
            <p><strong>Phosphorus</strong> is another vital nutrient that works alongside calcium to keep teeth strong. It can be found in foods such as eggs, fish, and nuts.</p>
    
            <h2>The Impact of Sugary and Acidic Foods</h2>
            <p>While certain foods help protect your teeth, others can contribute to oral health problems. Foods and drinks that are high in sugar—like candy, sodas, and baked goods—fuel the bacteria in your mouth, leading to the production of acids that attack tooth enamel. Over time, this can result in cavities and tooth decay.</p>
            <p>Acidic foods like citrus fruits and soft drinks can also erode enamel, leading to increased tooth sensitivity. If you consume acidic foods, it’s important to wait at least 30 minutes before brushing your teeth to avoid damaging softened enamel.</p>
    
            <h2>Healthy Eating Tips for a Bright Smile</h2>
            <p>To support optimal oral health, incorporate the following tips into your diet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods</strong>, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.</li>
                <li><strong>Drink plenty of water</strong> to help rinse away food particles and bacteria from your mouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid frequent snacking on sugary foods</strong>. Instead, choose healthier options like nuts, cheese, or vegetables.</li>
                <li><strong>Chew sugar-free gum</strong> to stimulate saliva production, which helps neutralize acids and remineralize enamel.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>By maintaining a balanced diet and making mindful choices, you can significantly improve your oral health and enjoy a brighter, healthier smile for years to come.</p>
